# modbus_write_and_read_registers2

## Name

modbus_write_and_read_registers2 - write and read many registers in a single transaction

## Synopsis

```c
int modbus_write_and_read_registers2(
    modbus_t *ctx,
    int write_addr, int write_nb, const uint16_t *src,
    int read_addr, int read_nb, const uint16_t *dest,
    int read_flags
);
```

## Description

The *modbus_write_and_read_registers2()* function shall write the content of the
`write_nb` holding registers from the array 'src' to the address `write_addr` of
the remote device then shall read the content of the `read_nb` holding registers
to the address `read_addr` of the remote device. The result of reading is stored
in `dest` array as word values (16 bits).

`read_flags` is a bit mask, which controls fine-tuned read behavior:

- `MODBUS_READ_REGISTERS_FLAG_INCLUDE_LEADING_VALUE` - include additional two leading bytes.
- `MODBUS_READ_REGISTERS_FLAG_SWAP_BYTES` - forcibly swap bytes in the received 16-bit values.

You must take care to allocate enough memory to store the results in `dest`
(at least `nb * sizeof(uint16_t)` if `MODBUS_READ_REGISTERS_FLAG_INCLUDE_LEADING_VALUE`
is present in `read_flags`, or `(nb + 1) * sizeof(uint16_t)` otherwise).

The function uses the Modbus function code 0x17 (write/read registers).

## Return value

The function shall return the number of read values if successful. Otherwise
it shall return -1 and set errno.

## Errors

- *EMBMDATA*, too many registers requested, Too many registers to write
